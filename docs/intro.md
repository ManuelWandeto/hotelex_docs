## Installation

Getting set up with Hotelex requires some initial preparation and equipment. Our support team will need to visit your site to ensure proper networking and cabling installation. 

The initial setup process involves our technicians installing or configuring a server, one or more P.O.S. stations, printers on your network and configuring the software for your specific business needs. This process can take some time and coordination. Please contact us at 0729089638 when you're ready to schedule an appointment to get Hotelex up and running in your business.
