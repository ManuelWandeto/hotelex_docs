# Departments

Hotelex incorporates the concept of departments to enable businesses to organize their operations into logical units.

Departments act as a means to segregate data, specify access control and define reporting structures in the system. Some ways departments are utilized include:

- User Access Rights - Access to software modules and data can be assigned department-wise. For example, housekeeping staff may only access rooms module.

- Point of Sale - Billing counters can be assigned to departments like restaurant, bar, etc. allowing sales tracking per department.

- Menu & Inventory - Menu items and inventory can be categorized into departments like kitchen, bar, etc.
Revenues and expenses can be tracked at department-level enabling analysis of profitability by department.

- Reports - Performance reports for sales, inventory, payroll etc. can be generated by department.
Some common departments defined in lounging businesses include:

  - Restaurant
  - Bar
  - Kitchen
  - Spa
  - Pool
  - Rooms
  - banquets  

The departments list is configurable and new departments can be added to the system when needed. Assigning resources like staff, counters, inventory to departments enables focused management and accountability.

Proper departmentalization provides matrix-like access control and reporting which equips businesses with insights to measure performance across different operational units.

Fill in your department's name. If it involves any printing, allocate a printer (by device name) that will be used to serve the department's orders and/or bills respectively.

If the department sells stock items, check it as a 'stocks sales department', and if it deals with rooms or banquets, be sure to check the appropriate box.
