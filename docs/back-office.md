# Introduction To Back Office (B.O)

The back office refers to the administrative interface that allows authorized users like managers and system administrators to configure settings, parameters and workflows in hotelex.

While frontline staff like cashiers, waiters and receptionist interact with the system mostly through the front-end point of sale interface, the back office provides the tools to manage fundamental setup and system defaults.

The key capabilities offered through the back office include:

- User Rights Management - Creating user profiles, assigning permissions and access levels to allow or restrict access to modules and functions across the system.

- Inventory Management - Issuing and management of stocks, store categories and POS items for sale.

- Integration Management - Defining linkages and workflows between modules like F&B, stocks, POS, payroll etc.

- Report Generation - Compiling and exporting a range of operational and analytical reports.

<!-- - System Administration - Performing functions like backups, restoring data, updates, monitoring for errors etc. -->

<!-- - Customization - Tweaking system parameters, custom fields, user interface elements to suit specific business needs. -->

- Audit Logs - Enables tracking user activities for monitoring and accountability.

The back office is essentially the central console for administrators to control the entire system and ensure optimal configurations for smooth front-end operations and management decision making. Its effective use is critical for implementing and sustaining automated processes through the hotel management system.
