# Your Till Summary

Your till summary shows an overview of the sales made by each waiter in each department and their paid and unpaid amounts for the currently selected counter.

## View Waiter Checks

Unlike a waiter's [order checks view](../pos-sales/orders.md#order-checks-view), your's can show soft copy checks of any or all waiters.

Click on the 'Order checks view' button, you will be asked whether you want to see checks for all waiters or the one that you have selected in your live summary.
