# Your view

This is where you clock in/out and get to view your account information such as your bills (unpaid, forwarded, unforwarded and credit bills), your sales target and your sales analysis. You can also use the message board to send a message to all users or a specific user.

## Shifts

Each waiter has a daily shift in which they must clock in and out of. You are required to clock in first before you can make any orders in the system. Your view will tell you if you are clocked in or not. If you have not clocked in, your view will have a background color of red.

And it will be green if you are clocked in.

If for any reason the shift is invalid, the system will not allow you to clock in.  

If you forgot to close a previous shift and want to clock in, you can close the old shift using the 'close all shifts' button.

You will not be able to clock out if the set shift duration is yet to end e.g If the shift is set for 6 hours, it cannot be closed in 3.
