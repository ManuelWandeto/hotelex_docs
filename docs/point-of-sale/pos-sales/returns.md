# Returns

You are allowed to request for a return of a specific item(s) in an order.  
This request must however be approved by a user with level 1 approval and another with level 2 approval rights respectively.

A return request has to be accepted by a user with level 1 approval (usually the cashier) first before the request can be presented to a user with level 2 approval (usually the manager).

If a return request is approved, the order on your account is reduced by the price of the returned item, the item is removed from the order and you are free to forward the other items.

If a return request is disapproved, the 'return' button seizes to appear for the order. You can however move the item to a new order in-order to request for a return once again.

A super-administrator can have both level 1 and level 2 approval rights at which point they can approve or disapprove a return request all by themselves.

An order that is locked with lock-status 'return' is highlighted in pink while and order locked with lock-status 'forwardded' is highlighted in yellow.
